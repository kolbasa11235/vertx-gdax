= Vert.x Maven Starter

This project is a template to start your own Vert.x project using Apache Maven.

== Prerequisites

* Apache Maven
* JDK 8+

== Getting started

Create your project with:

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/kolbasa11235/vertx-gdax.git PROJECT_NAME
----

Replace `PROJECT_NAME` with the name of your project.


== Running the project
java -jar <project location>/target/vertx-start-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT-fat.jar
----

The command compiles the project and runs the tests, then  it launches the application, so you can check by yourself. Open your browser to http://localhost:8080. You should see a _Hello World_ message.

== Anatomy of the project

The project contains:

* a `pom.xml` file
* a _main_ verticle file (src/main/java/io/vertx/starter/MyService.java)

== Start to hack

1. Delete the `.git` directory
2. Open the `pom.xml` file and customize the `groupId`, `artifactId` and `version`. You can also change the `main.verticle` property to use your own package name and verticle class.
3. Run `redeploy.sh` (or `redeploy.bat` on Windows) and the project recompiles while editing.

NOTE: the `redeploy` script are also configurable

== Building the project

To build the project, just use:

----
mvn clean package
----

It generates a _fat-jar_ in the `target` directory.
